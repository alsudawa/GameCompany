# 🧠 GameCompany Skills Library

Reusable know-how extracted from past projects. Every game ships with a postmortem; patterns that proved their worth land here.

## How to use

- **Before starting a game** — skim the index below, open the 3–4 most relevant docs.
- **Before writing a new utility** — grep the skills folder first; copy-adapt if a match exists.
- **After shipping a game** — update a skill doc if this project surfaced a new pattern. Date-stamp the addition.

## Index

### Gameplay
- [`gameplay/game-loop.md`](gameplay/game-loop.md) — fixed-timestep `requestAnimationFrame` loop with `dt` cap

- [`gameplay/difficulty-curve.md`](gameplay/difficulty-curve.md) — tuning ramps for the 60–90s session
- [`gameplay/pause-visibility.md`](gameplay/pause-visibility.md) — tab-hide pause + 3-2-1 countdown resume
- [`gameplay/anti-frustration.md`](gameplay/anti-frustration.md) — pity life on rage-retry, forgiveness levers
- [`gameplay/seeded-daily.md`](gameplay/seeded-daily.md) — deterministic daily challenge via `?seed=` + per-seed best

### Graphics

## Conventions

- Each doc has a **When to use** section + runnable code snippets.
- Snippets are copy-paste ready for `game.js` / `style.css` (no import syntax).
- If a pattern depends on constants, list them at the top so designers can tune.
- Date-stamp additions: `<!-- added: 2026-04-17 (001-<slug>) -->`
